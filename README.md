Files for a class assignment for STA304 Fall 2021 at the University of Toronto

The assignment required students to implement a survey using surveying tactics which were discussed in the course, and to analyze the results of their survey in order to draw conclusions corresponding to the information collected. 

My survey asked for people's ordering habits when buying food from McDonald's, and the survey is available at [this link](https://forms.gle/NDe1FuWxiCMu8tAk8).

The four .csv files in this repo represent the data collected in the survey prior to the creation of the report in which the data was analyzed. The analyses of the data can be found in the .Rmd file and the corresponding pdf which was created by knitting the RMarkdown document.
